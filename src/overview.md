# Rust You don't Know

Are you a Rustacean eager to explore the lesser-known realms of Rust? Look no further! We are proud to introduce our latest book, "Rust You Don't Know," a comprehensive guide diving deep into the intricacies of Unsafe Rust and Async Rust.

"Rust You Don't Know" is structured around two primary themes: Unsafe Rust and Async Rust. Each theme is accompanied by a series of specialized articles, providing readers with an in-depth understanding of these advanced aspects of the Rust programming language.

In the Unsafe Rust section, we explore the darker corners of the language, where developers can harness the raw power of memory management and low-level abstractions. This section covers topics such as pointers, raw memory allocation, and FFI (Foreign Function Interface). We aim to provide you with the knowledge and best practices necessary for working with unsafe code while maintaining Rust's core principle of safety.

The Async Rust section delves into the world of asynchronous programming, focusing on the cutting-edge concurrency model that Rust offers. In this section, you'll learn about async/await syntax, Futures, and the Tokio runtime, among other essential topics. Our goal is to empower you to build high-performance, concurrent applications while avoiding common pitfalls and ensuring code maintainability.

"Rust You Don't Know" is designed for intermediate to advanced Rust developers who want to enhance their understanding of the language and unlock its full potential. With this book, you'll gain valuable insights, tips, and techniques that will elevate your Rust programming skills to new heights.

Join us on this exciting journey as we unveil the secrets of Rust that you don't know yet!
